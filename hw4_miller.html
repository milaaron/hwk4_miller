Do female na'vi wear battle band? After the young Na'vi has completed Iknimaya, they receive a battle band. But in the film, only male na'vi in both Omatikaya and Metcayina and also Tayrangi wore them. So the question is &gt;\024                                              2023-03-03

What Skxawng at Hot Toys made Eytukan's bow so small? This figure is nearly four hundred USD and they make mistakes like this.                                                                                                                                                  2023-03-01

I'm a little confused as many people seem to refer to Kiri as the daughter of Eywa when ib canon she's the daughter of Grace's Avatar. Could someone explain the thought process to me?

Na'Vi fan art WIP. I've been testing different lighting setups and working on the pose. Now it's time to make the hair, add textures to the clothes and add more details.

What do you think Jake tell his kids when they ask him what life on earth was like?

What connection does Norm have with the Olangi Clan?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I was looking through the visual dictionary and I found that Norm has a lot of items that are in the Olangi style, just wondering why he's so inspired by them.

I loved the movie and that's why I decided to draw Neityri.\nWhat did you think?
Got a nice surprise in the mail today, almost forgot I ordered these months ago.

I feel like Jake\031s status in the military is overlooked by most people\024 because most people don\031t know much about the military or what the \034First Recon.\035 title means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      he wasn\031t just a marine, he was extremely skilled and highly trained to be deadly. knowing this info now lowkey refigures my view on Jake and it honestly adds more to the minuet details of the characters and the story (i.e Jake and Quaritch\031s character similarities and how that personality type reacts to specific scenarios in the story, as well as the polar opposite love story we see between Jake and Neytiri, purest form of a nature/natural/peaceful being vs a technology based being who is very opposing of nature). idk this is all random thoughts i\031ve had while noticing small details about the movie.

Me after hearing about people debating on how exactly do the na'vi mate:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
What deleted scenes do you think we'll see in Avatar 3?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Do female na'vi wear battle band? After the young Na'vi has completed Iknimaya, they receive a battle band. But in the film, only male na'vi in both Omatikaya and Metcayina and also Tayrangi wore them. So the question is &gt;\024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
If Duolingo has Klingon and High Valyrion, Why not add Na'vi too?                                                                                                                                                                                                               Would anyone else besides me love it if Duolingo added Na'vi to their list of courses? They already have conlangs like Klingon and High Valyrion, there's no reason why Na'vi can't be added to the list of conlangs.\n\nDo you think it's likely Duolingo might eventually add Na'vi?\n\nEdit: I didn't post this to be divisive. I agree it would be awesome for Duolingo to continue adding courses for less common/endangered languages. I noticed they're working on adding a course for Xhosa right now, which is great! My original point was that since Duolingo has courses for conlangs like Klingon and High Valyrion, it would be neat if they also added Na'vi one day. \n\nDuolingo seems like the kind of company that can do both real languages and conlangs at the same time. I was not trying to present a black or white, either/or scenario. Those who are suggesting such are taking my post out of context.

I'm a little confused as many people seem to refer to Kiri as the daughter of Eywa when ib canon she's the daughter of Grace's Avatar. Could someone explain the thought process to me?                                                                                            Avatar

I'm a little confused as many people seem to refer to Kiri as the daughter of Eywa when ib canon she's the daughter of Grace's Avatar. Could someone explain the thought process to me?                                                                                              165

Why do people say the navi have sex with their hair ? It\031s very clear they have a womb implying they have sex the way humans do hence the pregnant bellies in avatar 2                                                                                                            180

I see you, I mean it\031s hard not to &gt;# I got this and 4-5 different ones that I\031ve not unravelled other than a neytiri one, not quite sure what to do with them yet lol                                                                                                          65
Imagine being an uncontacted navi and then one day just seeing this thing walking thru the forest. I think we underestimate how weird all of this is for them. They could still compare guns to their bows and arrows but how will you rationalise something that looks like...       48
The absolute chokehold avatar has had on me since I was a little girl -=\002                                                                                                                                                                                                          29

Why do people in the avatar community get so butthurt when you say your a rda supporter? Lol most of us just like the cool tech and the marines, it\031s all fictional anyways                                                                                                       237

Why is avatar called a white savior movie ? Jake didn\031t save the navi, Eywa did. Jake also was saved by neytiri so that Criticism doesn\031t make sense.                                                                                                                          115

"A son for a Son" - Jake Sully, what does he mean? Neytiri said it in context of revenge and killing                                                                                                                                                                                  43
